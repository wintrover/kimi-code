# Generate Changesets

`kimi-code` uses changesets to manage versions and changelogs. The current user-facing published package is:

- `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code`: the CLI

All other `@moonshot-ai/*` packages are treated as internal packages, including `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk`, `agent-core`, `kosong`, `kaos`, `kimi-code-oauth`, `kimi-telemetry`, and `migration-legacy`.

## Core Rules

1. **Inspect the actual changes first.** Use `git status` / `git diff --name-only` to identify which packages were actually changed.
2. **List packages that were actually changed.** Source code, build config, package metadata, and other changes that affect a package's output or behavior need a changeset entry for that package.
3. **Do not list unchanged internal packages.** For example, if `packages/node-sdk` was not changed, do not list `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk` just because another internal package changed. The SDK follows the same rule as other internal packages: list it only when it was actually changed.
4. **Internal package source changes that enter the CLI bundle must manually list the CLI.** `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code` inline-bundles `@moonshot-ai/*` source, but those internal packages are devDependencies from the CLI's perspective, so changesets will not automatically propagate bumps. If a change enters the CLI output, also list `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code`.
5. **Docs-only and tests-only changes usually do not need a changeset.** README, internal docs, and `test/` changes that do not enter package output do not trigger a CLI bump.
6. `@moonshot-ai/vis` / `vis-server` / `vis-web` are ignored by changesets and should not be handled.

## Workflow

1. If the change includes `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, root or workspace `package.json`, `.npmrc`, `flake.nix`, or `flake.lock`:
   - First check `command -v nix >/dev/null 2>&1`.
   - If `nix` exists, run `nix run .#update-pnpm-deps`.
   - If `nix` is unavailable, skip this step and do not block the changeset; mention in the final response that the command was not run.
2. List the packages that were actually changed.
3. Choose a bump level for each package.
4. If an internal package change enters the CLI bundle, add `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code`.
5. Create a short kebab-case file under `.changeset/`.
6. Split unrelated changes into separate changesets; keep one logical change in one file.

Format:

```markdown
---
"<package A>": patch
"<package B>": minor
---

<English changelog entry>
```

## Bump Levels

| Level | When to use |
|---|---|
| `patch` | Bug fixes; build/package fixes; internal refactors that do not change behavior; wording tweaks; small dependency upgrades |
| `minor` | New backwards-compatible features or capabilities |
| `major` | Breaking changes: incompatible config changes, renamed or removed commands/arguments, behavior semantics changes, and similar |

### Major Rule

Never write `major` on your own.

If you believe a change qualifies as major, stop first, explain why, and ask the user for confirmation. Only write `major` after the user explicitly agrees. If the user does not reply, replies ambiguously, or disagrees, fall back to `minor`; if `minor` is also unclear, fall back to `patch`.

## Wording Rules

- Changelog entries **must be written in English**.
- User-facing CLI wording should only be used when CLI users can perceive the change.
- Internal changes that do not affect CLI users can still share a changeset with the CLI, but the wording must describe the real change honestly and must not present it as a user-facing feature.
- Do not mention file names, class names, function names, PR numbers, or commit hashes.
- Avoid vague words such as `refactor`, `optimize`, and `improve`. Describe the actual change, or use more specific wording.

## Common Examples

An internal package fixes a bug visible to CLI users:

```markdown
---
"@moonshot-ai/agent-core": patch
"@moonshot-ai/kimi-code": patch
---

Fix occasional loss of tool call results in long conversations.
```

An internal package has an internal-only change, but it enters the CLI bundle:

```markdown
---
"@moonshot-ai/agent-core": patch
"@moonshot-ai/kimi-code": patch
---

Unify tool execution metadata handling.
```

Only SDK source changed, and the CLI does not use it:

```markdown
---
"@moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk": patch
---

Clarify session status typing for internal SDK callers.
```

## Red Flags

- You are about to write `major` without asking the user.
- Internal package source enters the CLI bundle, but `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code` is missing.
- `packages/node-sdk` was not changed, but `@moonshot-ai/kimi-code-sdk` was listed for "internal package sync".
- The changelog entry is in Chinese.
- The wording claims more than the diff actually did.
- The CLI wording mentions internal package names, class names, or PR numbers.
